# ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End
The challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application was created in order to be able to demonstrate the full functionality and capabilities of being able to create a back end for an e-commerce site that allows the user to create a developmental database. This will then be seeded with the test data which will be synced with MySQL. This application proved to be quite challenging due to the nature of this being a first time attempt with working with all the necessary knowledge to create a back end for an e-commerce site that works with Express.js API. There were various trial and errors when using the code to create certain js configuration while working with certain JavaScript that related with different categories, product tags, etc. It was very much a project that consisted of trial and effort based efforts which helped create the application which had to implement various techniques which were difficult to achieve due to lack of experience. What makes the project stand on its own is being able to implement various code displaying all the necessary JavaScript code and knowledge of Express.js, API, and MYSQL.
